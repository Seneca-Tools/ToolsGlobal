# Tools-Global

## Application
This is based on the streamlined version of SDDSTools which is focused on data for the ITAS, SDDS, and SCPA schools, however this version supports data for ALL Schools operating out of Newnham and Markham campuses(requires more memory for datastore!).

## About the Code
This is coded using TypeScript, so any changes should be made in the ts folder script file **"main.ts"**, then compiled using `tsc` to generate the output **"main.js"** javascript file.  

Unfortunately, the output javascript file will not retain a lot of the formatting applied in the .ts file. However, this shouldn't really matter since the main coding file should only be the **main.ts** code file :)
